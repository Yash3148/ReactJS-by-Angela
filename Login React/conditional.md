# Conditional (ternary) operator

The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement.

function getFee(isMember) {
  return isMember ? '$2.00' : '$10.00';
}

console.log(getFee(true));
// Expected output: "$2.00"

console.log(getFee(false));
// Expected output: "$10.00"

console.log(getFee(null));
// Expected output: "$10.00"
